\section{Introduction}
Text classification remains a fundamental challenge in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning from sentiment analysis to document categorization. While deep learning approaches have achieved remarkable success in this domain, the requirement for large-scale labeled datasets continues to be a significant bottleneck \cite{zhang2015character}. Data augmentation (DA) has emerged as a pivotal technique to address this limitation by artificially expanding the training dataset, thereby enhancing model robustness and generalization \cite{wei2019eda}.

Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, Claude, Llama etc. have revolutionized the field of NLP by offering advanced capabilities in text generation and understanding \cite{brown2020language} \cite{llama3}. The emergence of prompt engineering as a paradigm for interacting with LLMs has revolutionized how we approach NLP tasks \cite{liu2023pre}. These models have been leveraged for data augmentation, providing novel methods to generate synthetic data that can improve the performance of text classification models \cite{zhao2024improving}. The use of LLMs for DA can be broadly categorized into two approaches: rewriting existing data and generating entirely new samples \cite{yang2023mini}. The integration of prompt engineering with LLMs has further enhanced the potential of DA.

Current literature has explored various prompting techniques, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \cite{wei2023chain}, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) \cite{yao2023tree}, and Self-Consistency \cite{wang2023self}. While these methods have shown promise in reasoning tasks, their effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic data for text classification has not been comprehensively studied to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the relationship between different prompting strategies and the quality of augmented datasets remains under-explored.

Our research aims to fill these gaps by focusing on two key objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing a prompt engineering technique to maximize classification model performance through LLM-based data augmentation.
    \item Conducting a comparative study of various prompting techniques, including CoT, ToT, and Self-Consistency, to evaluate their impact on the quality of augmented datasets.
\end{enumerate}

% This study builds upon existing work in the field, such as the LAMBADA method for data augmentation \cite{anaby2019not}, and explores the potential of LLMs to generate diverse and informative data samples. By systematically analyzing different prompting strategies, we aim to establish best practices for leveraging LLMs in text classification tasks.
